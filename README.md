**"When compliance theater becomes weaponized deception."**

**LifeGuard Genesis** is a novel adaptive security and high-interaction deception platform that uses biological metaphors (protein folding, enzyme kinetics, circadian rhythms, immune response) to implement real cryptographic protections and ultra-realistic honeypots tailored for life-sciences environments (biotech, pharma, clinical trials).

Originally performance art. Now a citable, monitored, containerized deception system.

### Features
- Real Fernet (AES-128-GCM) + PBKDF2 encryption (no more DNA-XOR)
- Token-bucket rate limiting (no `time.sleep()` DoS)
- Full SHA-256 protein-folding authentication
- Secure, expiring session management
- High-interaction honeypots with fake CRISPR, Alzheimer’s, cancer immunotherapy projects
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- Docker / docker-compose ready

### Quick Start
```bash
docker compose up --build
